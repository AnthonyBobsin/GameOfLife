This program was done as an assignment for my Introduction to Operating Systems Course.

It is a program written in C portraying Conway's Game of Life. A1.c uses seperate threads,
while A1bp.c does not.

A1.c takes two arguments: first argument is a file with a starting grid, such as the one provided in
input.txt, and the second argument is the number of threads you would like to use to handle this program.

A1bp.c takes one argument: The file containing a starting grid in a similar format to input.txt.

In order to run either, just compile without any flags and run them with the appropriate amount of arguments.
